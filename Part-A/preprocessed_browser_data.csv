● Private browsing: 

Use private tabs to go incognito anywhere on the Internet without leaving a trace on your device. Easily switch between private and normal browsing in the tab gallery.

● Read comfortably on any screen: 

The Opera browser includes a text size setting which helps you adapt pages according to your reading preferences. More importantly, it works perfectly together with our automatic text wrap feature for an unparalleled reading experience.

● Manage downloads easily: 

Our new download manager makes downloading files easier and faster than ever! You can easily sort and share each downloaded item, delete them from your phone or remove them from your list of downloads with a quick swipe to the right or left side.  We even support background downloading when you have a download running but need to open another application!

● Home screen shortcuts:

Available on Android versions 7.1 or later, Opera offers fast access from the home screen to search, open a new private tab or scan QR codes. To create your own home screen shortcut, long tap on the Opera icon in your device’s home screen and tap your desired function. 

● Sync your Opera devices: 

Give yourself access to all your bookmarks, Speed Dial shortcuts and open tabs from your other devices with Opera. Opera on Android can now easily sync with the Opera browser for computers.

● Browser startup options:

Everyone is individual, so we let you choose whether to always open the browser with a new tab or to continue browsing where you left off, and to choose to close or preserve your open tabs when you exit the browser.

1422,android browser,5,com.cloudmosa.puffinTV,Puffin TV Browser - One App to Watch All Videos on the Web.,"Puffin TV Browser is a special edition of Puffin Web Browser optimized for the Android TV.

Why we need to install one video app for each video channel on Android TV? PC users can watch all videos from any web browser on their PC. What if we can have a web browser optimized for the Android TV?

Puffin TV Browser removes the traditional web browser UI for a fully immersed Android TV experience. Puffin UI is kept as subtle and intuitive as possible. For example, Puffin TV automatically recommends most popular sites for users. It has never been easier to share a page from your smart phone to Puffin TV Browser.

☆ Incredible page load and rendering speed
☆ Optimized video playback
☆ Intuitive app navigation design
☆ Sharing pages to Puffin TV Browser from any devices
☆ Full web experience
☆ Fastest JavaScript engine

===== In-app purchase =====
* The service is provided with limited free usage everyday.
* Users may choose to unlock limited access via in-app purchase.

===== Limitations =====
* The data centers of Puffin are in the US and the cloud servers can only access public web sites from US geolocations.
* For users outside the US, local contents, especially videos of local interest, may not be accessible from the US due to geo-restrictions in their home countries.
