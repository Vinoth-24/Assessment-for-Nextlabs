ANS :
For a set of pairs to be a subspace of vector space V, the following conditions needs to be satisfied.
- Zero vector must be in the subset
- It must be closed under addition
- It must be closed under scalar multiplication

From analysing the subset pairs given with constraints for Vector space, the following are my conclusions:

1. Not a subspace bcoz of no zero vector in subset.
2. Not a subspace bcoz scalar multiplication condition is not satisfied.
3. It is a subspace
4. It is not a subspace bcoz scalar multiplication condition is not satisfied.
